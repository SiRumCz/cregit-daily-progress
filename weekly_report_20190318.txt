Mar 18th to 22nd:
- working on perl script to generate html views.
- this process took massive amount of my time because I was trying many different methods, such as read and write to a local txt files and it works as a local cache file.
- Many approaches ends up failing because of the massive I/O activity and has very slow processing time even on small project such as Git repository.
