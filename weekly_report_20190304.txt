Mar 4th:
- fix bugs
- create a pull request on github for the directory view

Mar 5th to 8th:
- My first script that genderates html view for directory would take very long time to
process on large project such as Linux kernel.
- I had discussion with Dr. German on this and he pointed out my code used too many 
memory and also the loading time for browser to load html view was also too long and 
have a very high chance to crash the browser. I then started to rebuild my script.
- My new idea was to instead build a full structure of the repository, we go into the 
deepest subdirectory and from there it starts generate html view.
