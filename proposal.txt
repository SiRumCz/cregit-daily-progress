Create a directory view for CREGIT.

Goal: provide a more efficient way to 1) have a clear view on who has contributed to the directory and 
by how they have contributed in terms of token and commit work. 2) identify the amount of contribution 
of each contributor has done to the contents(subdirectories and files)

Some visual:
Top 50 contributors have colors and the rest will be grey.
Each content(subdirectory and file) will have a stacked bar which contains the token proportion of each 
contributor has done to the content.

Highlighting:
